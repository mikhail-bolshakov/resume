<h2>What drives me</h2> 
<p>I love data in all shapes and forms to the extent where I call myself a "data junkie". 
I enjoy challenges, complex projects, tricky requests and questions. I take pride in what I do and how I do that, 
find satisfaction in doing my job in the best possible way - delivering high-quality, robust and scalable product | solutions and 
leaving my stakeholders happy. 
<br> 
<br> 
My peers say that I have great work ethic, responsive to requests, very service-oriented and fix everything in flash mode. 
I like to think of myself as a perfectionist and try to be very  thorough and disciplined with my code, organise and document everything. 
I am always curious about new technologies, concepts, tools and everything related to data.

<h2>My working compass</h2> 
<li> BI | Data Analytics is a customer service industry, therefore the most important aspect of the well-functioning and healthy BI | Data Team operation
within company business ecosystem - stakeholder communication, not daily meeting and syncs, but communication where all users are 100% aligned on 
expectations, goals, timeline, logic and end results.</li> 
<br>
<li> BI | Data Team goal is to help people make a decision they trust based on data they trust. Building trust in analytics is essential
in every step of data service, ranging from the source data to how the report insights are interpreted.  
Building trust in data facilitates faster analytic cycles and creates strong trust in the analytic process and data platform, which results in 
confident and high-yielding data-driven actions.
I believe, it makes that trust score is one of the accurate, objective and true to life indicators of BI | Data Team performance, and that metric 
should be monitored and tracked.</li>
