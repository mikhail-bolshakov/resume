<h2>What drives me</h2> 
<p>I like to think of myself as a "data junkie", who enjoys complex projects (both technical and analytical), 
tricky requests and "head-scratcher" tasks. 
<br> 
<br> 
My peers say that I have great work ethic, responsive to requests and very service-oriented.
I take pride in the product I create and have customer-first mentality - always seek for a feedback 
as one of the ways to develop and grow. I strive in the environment where values like ownership, 
transparency, reliability and fail-fast mentality are appreciated and nurtured.
<br> 
<br>
I understand the importance of the ability to prioritize, so every project I start with 
asking questions to evaluate impact vs effort ratios. I manage my stakeholders, their 
expectations and projects with suave and panache and do not hesitate to say no when i have to.
<br> 
<br>
I recognize my failures, always learn from them and move forward twice faster. 
I always meet new challenges head on and get job done.


<br> 
<br>
<h2> My values</h2> 
<li> Fail Fast
     Am not intimidated by failure. I embrace it and take it as a chance to develop, 
     learn, and try again. I break larger problems into smaller ones and run many 
     little experiments, knowing that some will work and grow and others will fail and die. 
     Room for failure means room for personal learning and growth.
</li> 
<br>
<li> On Fire
     Always ready for action, fostering creative solutions and growth mentality 
     by never settling for and always questioning the status quo. I improve my 
     skill and innovate, think outside of the box, foster creative solutions and 
     growth mentality.
</li>
<br>
<li> Communicate To Excel
    I adopt a culture where I communicate openly, timely, honestly, and transparently 
    with fellow team members and stakeholders. This mindset promotes clarity and free 
    exchange of information, leading to improved collaboration, trust, and overall 
    data product quality. Stakeholder feedback is always greatly appreciated.

</li>
<br>
<li> Customer First
    I understand the importance of prioritizing the needs, satisfaction, and overall 
    experience of the data customers. It reflects the my commitment to delivering exceptional 
    value and exceeding my users expectations.
